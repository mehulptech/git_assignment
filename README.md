# a. What is an issue?

An issue in Git is a way to track bugs, feature requests, or other tasks related to a project. It is typically used in project management and collaboration platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Issues provide a structured way to document, discuss, and resolve problems or enhancements in a project.

Key features of an issue in Git include:
a) Title and Description: Each issue has a title that summarizes the problem or request, along with a detailed description that provides more context.
b) Labels: Labels can be used to categorize issues, such as "bug," "feature," "enhancement," or "documentation."
c) Assignees: Issues can be assigned to specific team members who are responsible for addressing them.
d) Milestones: Issues can be associated with milestones to track progress towards project goals.
e) Comments: Team members can add comments to discuss the issue, provide updates, or ask for clarification.
f) Status: Issues can be marked as open, in progress, or closed to indicate their current status.

By using issues, teams can effectively manage their workflow, prioritize tasks, and ensure that all aspects of the project are addressed in a timely and organized manner.

# b. What is a pull request?

A pull request in Git is a mechanism for developers to notify team members that they have completed a feature or bug fix and would like to merge their changes into the main codebase. It facilitates code review, discussion, and collaboration before the changes are integrated.

Here are the key aspects of a pull request:

a) Proposal for Changes: A pull request is essentially a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. It allows team members to review the proposed changes before they are merged.
b) Code Review: Pull requests enable team members to review the code, suggest improvements, and discuss any issues or concerns. This process helps ensure code quality and consistency.
c) Discussion and Feedback: Team members can leave comments on specific lines of code, discuss the changes, and provide feedback. This collaborative process helps in refining the code and catching potential issues early.
d) Automated Testing: Many platforms that support pull requests, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, can integrate with continuous integration (CI) tools to automatically run tests on the proposed changes. This ensures that the new code does not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.
e) Approval and Merging: Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, the pull request can be merged into the target branch. This typically involves clicking a "Merge" button on the platform, which combines the changes from the source branch into the target branch.

In summary, a pull request is a powerful tool for collaborative development, enabling teams to review, discuss, and integrate changes efficiently and effectively.

# c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

To open a pull request in GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Create a New Branch: Before making changes, create a new branch from the main branch (or the branch you want to base your changes on). You can do this using the following command in your terminal:
   git checkout -b new-branch-name

2. Make Your Changes: Edit the files as needed to implement your feature or fix.

3. Stage and Commit Your Changes: Once you've made your changes, stage them using git add and then commit them with a meaningful commit message:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"

4. Push Your Branch to GitHub: Push your new branch to the remote repository on GitHub:
   git push origin new-branch-name

5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub:
   5.1) Go to your repository on GitHub.
   You should see a banner or a button suggesting that you recently pushed a branch and offering to open a pull request. Click on "Compare & pull request." If you don't see the banner, you can manually navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click on "New pull request."
   5.2) Select the Branches:
   In the "base" dropdown, select the branch you want to merge your changes into (usually main or master).
   In the "compare" dropdown, select the branch that contains your changes (the branch you just pushed).
   5.3) Fill Out the Pull Request Form:
   Provide a descriptive title for your pull request.
   Write a detailed description explaining what your changes do, why they are necessary, and any other relevant information.
   Optionally, you can add labels, assign reviewers, and link issues related to your pull request.
   5.4) Create the Pull Request: Click on "Create pull request" to submit your request for review.

Your pull request is now open, and your team members can review your changes, provide feedback, and eventually merge your branch into the main codebase.

# d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

To add a collaborator to a GitHub repository and share write permissions, follow these steps:

1. Access the Repository:
   Log in to your GitHub account.
   Navigate to the repository where you want to add a collaborator.
2. Go to Repository Settings:
   On the repository's main page, click on the Settings tab located near the top of the page, usually next to Security and Insights.
3. Navigate to Collaborators:
   In the left sidebar, under the "Access" section, click on Collaborators & teams.
4. Add a Collaborator:
   In the "Manage Access" section, click the Invite a collaborator button.
   In the search box that appears, type the GitHub username or email address of the person you want to add.
   Select the correct user from the list.
5. Set Permissions:
   After selecting the user, you can set their permissions. For write access, select Write from the available options. You can also choose other permission levels like Read, Triage, Maintain, or Admin depending on what you want them to do.
6. Send the Invitation:
   Click the Send invitation button. The user will receive an email invitation.
7. Wait for Acceptance:
   The invited collaborator will need to accept the invitation. Once they accept, they will have the permissions you assigned.
8. Confirmation:
   You can confirm the collaborator has accepted by checking the Collaborators list in the repository settings. Once accepted, their status will change from "Pending" to active.
   Now the collaborator can push commits and manage the repository based on the permissions you've assigned.

# e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git and GitHub are closely related but serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1. What They Are:
   Git:
   Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development.
   It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
   Git is a command-line tool that can be installed on your local machine.
   GitHub:
   GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides a web interface for version control and collaboration.
   It adds a social and collaborative layer to Git, allowing users to share code, track issues, and review contributions.
   GitHub is a service (now owned by Microsoft) that makes it easier to use Git, especially for distributed teams.
2. Functions:
   Git:
   Manages code versions, tracks changes, and facilitates branching and merging.
   Operates locally on your machine, but can be used with remote repositories.
   Provides commands like git init, git commit, git branch, git merge, and git pull.
   GitHub:
   Hosts repositories in the cloud, making them accessible from anywhere.
   Offers additional features like pull requests, issues tracking, wikis, and project boards.
   Provides integration with various CI/CD pipelines, and third-party tools, and allows team collaboration.
3. Usage:
   Git:
   Primarily used through the command line or Git GUI clients.
   You can use Git without GitHub by setting up your own remote repository or working entirely locally.
   GitHub:
   Used through a web browser or GitHub desktop application.
   Enhances Git by offering a centralized location for remote repositories and collaboration features.
4. Ownership and Accessibility:
   Git:
   Open-source and maintained by a large community.
   Free to use on any platform, without the need for an account.
   GitHub:
   A proprietary platform with free and paid plans.
   Requires an account to create repositories, collaborate on projects, or use its other features.
5. Scope:
   Git:
   Focuses solely on version control.
   Used by many platforms, including Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub.
   GitHub:
   Extends Git with additional tools for project management, collaboration, and code review.
   Specific to Git, but similar services like GitLab and Bitbucket provide comparable features.

In summary, Git is the underlying technology that handles version control, while GitHub is a platform built on top of Git to make it easier to collaborate, manage, and share code with others.

# f. What does git diff do?

g. What is the main branch?

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
