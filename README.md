# a. What is an issue?

An issue in Git is a way to track bugs, feature requests, or other tasks related to a project. It is typically used in project management and collaboration platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Issues provide a structured way to document, discuss, and resolve problems or enhancements in a project.

Key features of an issue in Git include:
a) Title and Description: Each issue has a title that summarizes the problem or request, along with a detailed description that provides more context.
b) Labels: Labels can be used to categorize issues, such as "bug," "feature," "enhancement," or "documentation."
c) Assignees: Issues can be assigned to specific team members who are responsible for addressing them.
d) Milestones: Issues can be associated with milestones to track progress towards project goals.
e) Comments: Team members can add comments to discuss the issue, provide updates, or ask for clarification.
f) Status: Issues can be marked as open, in progress, or closed to indicate their current status.

By using issues, teams can effectively manage their workflow, prioritize tasks, and ensure that all aspects of the project are addressed in a timely and organized manner.

# b. What is a pull request?

A pull request in Git is a mechanism for developers to notify team members that they have completed a feature or bug fix and would like to merge their changes into the main codebase. It facilitates code review, discussion, and collaboration before the changes are integrated.

Here are the key aspects of a pull request:

a) Proposal for Changes: A pull request is essentially a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. It allows team members to review the proposed changes before they are merged.
b) Code Review: Pull requests enable team members to review the code, suggest improvements, and discuss any issues or concerns. This process helps ensure code quality and consistency.
c) Discussion and Feedback: Team members can leave comments on specific lines of code, discuss the changes, and provide feedback. This collaborative process helps in refining the code and catching potential issues early.
d) Automated Testing: Many platforms that support pull requests, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, can integrate with continuous integration (CI) tools to automatically run tests on the proposed changes. This ensures that the new code does not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.
e) Approval and Merging: Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, the pull request can be merged into the target branch. This typically involves clicking a "Merge" button on the platform, which combines the changes from the source branch into the target branch.

In summary, a pull request is a powerful tool for collaborative development, enabling teams to review, discuss, and integrate changes efficiently and effectively.
